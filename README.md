# CareerManagerContinued
Career Lite for Kerbal Space Program


This is a continuation of an older mod, CareerManager, by @bananashavings, original thread is here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/134429-11.  The mod originally came from CareerLite, original thread for that is here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112095-1

CareerManager

 

Description:

This mod allows you to lock your funds and science at max, and also is bundled with complete reversibility. If that isn't enough, it also allows you to upgrade all buildings and topple the tech tree, again with full reversibility. It is a phenomenal mod for people who want to utilize some aspects of a career game (such as Kerbal Leveling) but without having to worry about money. I know you can partially do this with the debug menu, but I believe this can be much more elegant and again, has more features.

New Feature: Kickstart Career, allows you to kickstart a career by unlocking the first few levels of the tech tree

The new version for KSP 1.4.1 has new dependencies
